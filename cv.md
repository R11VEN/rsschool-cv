About Me:
------------------------------

My career began in a small private brewery, where a year later I was involved, one might say, at almost all stages of production and sales of products. I worked there for three years, before moving to another country. During this time, I gained valuable and versatile experience, became the soul of a small team.


At my new place of residence, I got a job as a consultant in a new retail chain of household appliances. It so happened that as a consultant (although in our time this is a very generalized concept) I have worked for as many as seven years in three different retail chains. I loved my job as long as it was to provide quality customer service. But everything changed, the priority was already to sell what the company needed and I decided to leave. During my entire work as a consultant, I have made many friends. The fear of communicating with strangers is gone. I had to make decisions in non-standard situations, and in recent years, it seemed to me that even in the army it was easier.


In parallel with my work as a consultant, my wife and I were engaged in the development of communities in social networks. After my dismissal, we decided to live in Thailand for several months. I took over most of the work, from content to posting ads and accepting payments. Everything suited us, we traveled a lot. But the last two years, due to the situation in the world and not only, incomes began to fall. And I decided not to stagnate and try something new. And my friends advised me to go to IT - former colleagues who themselves already work there.
